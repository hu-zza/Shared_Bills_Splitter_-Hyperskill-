# Shared_Bills_Splitter_-Hyperskill-

#### Core: Spring Boot, JPA, Stream API

A project from JetBrains Academy:

## About  
  
Sharing a meal in a cafe or a few drinks in a bar is a great way to spend quality time with friends, though all the fun disappears when it's time to split the bill... Calculating who pays what and making sure it's fair and precise is just daunting. In this project, you will write a program that will solve this problem once and for all.
  
  
## Learning outcomes  
  
You will create a Spring Boot program that you'll actually be able to use at a dinner party and impress everyone! During the project, you'll try managing finances in BigDecimal class and learn how to work with string operations, regexp, collections, set operations, lambda, and stream API for complex querying data.
